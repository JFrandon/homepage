    I must not fear.  
    Fear is the mind-killer.  
    Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.  
    I will face my fear.  
    I will permit it to pass over me and through me.  
    And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.  
    Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.  

Frank Herbert (Dune)
