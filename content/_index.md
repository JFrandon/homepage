# Jeremy Frandon's homepage

Thanks for checking in. As of writing I'm feeling *content*.

## Welcome

This is the place I'm gonna digitalize my physical notes to.  
This website is provided "as is", without warranties of any kind.  
Expect no consistency, purpose, nor accuracy.  
Expect content in multiple languages (mostly English and French).  

## Things being posted

Right now the main things you'll see updated are my [poems](/poems).  
Be warned about their dubious quality.

I am uploading notes from various notebooks.  
I'll try to get the sections organized 
- [Litanies](/litanies)
- [Maths proofs](/maths)


## Things living elsewhere

Some of my old projects are floating on the interwebs:
  - [Time since the last HI episode](https://hi-api.warts.workers.dev/)
  - [Art of war quote generator](https://distraction.warts.workers.dev/)
