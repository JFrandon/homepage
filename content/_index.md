# Who I am

Thanks for your interest, I am someone deeply passionate about systems and who's been studying computer systems since 2014.

In 2018, I left my home country to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at McGill University. I obtained this B.Sc. in 2021 with distinction.
There I had the honour to [work](letters/ron_letter.pdf) with Ron Simpson to gain professional experience.


I am currently pursuing a PhD in information systems engineering at Concordia University.  
If you would like a concise summary of my projects and achievements, you can access [my CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mRWk2itKdYItqLIBDgH_ulbXy8cYBeHaL6dRLtda3_8/edit?usp=sharing)
